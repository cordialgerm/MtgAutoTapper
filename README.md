# MtgAutoTapper

## Project Goal

**Magic: The Gathering** (MTG) is a trading card game with millions of players world-wide. The game offers many interesting applications to analytics and data science.

This project examines the tactical and strategic implications of **Tapping Mana**, with the goal in mind of developing a general purpose **Tapping Algorithm** that can be used to identify a good (or perhaps even optimal) tapping strategy. We will refer to the **Tapping Algorithm** as the **"Auto-Tap"** (because such algorithms are often implemented in digital representations of Magic).

Roughly each week, I will add an article introducing the problem, discussing various solution techniques, and detailing how to go about building and testing an "Auto-Tap" algorithm.
